# Movie-DataBase

This is a simple Movie Database that requires a user login, it comes with a register form which will allow any user to register to the site.
Once the authentication is verified the user will have access to the OMDBAPI movies, the user will be able to search for a movie title, this will return the first Movie/Tv Show with the name listed, the actors and plot.
There is also a Recommendation link where the user can recommend movies to other users and a recently viewed link to show each user all the movies that have been searched.


This was created by EFTN, I hope youe enjoy :)
